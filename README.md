# SummerSNTGameDev
In my project, I chose to create the house, gun, and all three maps using Blender instead of using pre-made models from the internet, as I preferred full control over the design. For shooting mechanics, I scripted a bullet system where a bullet GameObject is instantiated and given velocity in the forward direction of the object it spawns from. To handle camera movement, I used the X-axis input from the mouse and applied it to the player's rotation, allowing the camera (which follows the player) to turn smoothlyâ€”while intentionally excluding Y-axis input to avoid confusing vertical movement. Initially, I tried changing the player's position directly for movement, but this caused issues like passing through walls, so I switched to using velocity with ForceMode for more realistic physics. On the animation side, I implemented gun recoil, panel opening, and enemy rotation to simulate movement. However, panel animations don't apply to the pause menu since Time.timeScale is set to 0 during pause, which stops all animations. For win and loss sounds, I attached audio sources directly to the respective panels and enabled "Play On Awake" so the sounds trigger automatically when the panels become active, removing the need for additional scripting. I created a video playing the game which there in repo. Its more then 100 MB so I had to use GIT LFS. please watch the video for reference.
